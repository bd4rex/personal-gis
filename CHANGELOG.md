This changelog documents user-visible development milestones. It follows the human-readable grouping used by mature open-source projects and records ISO 8601 timestamps.

The repository had no tags or GitHub Releases before this file was introduced. The `M0.x` labels below are retrospective documentation labels. Commit hashes and timestamps are the source of truth; no historical releases are implied.

## Unreleased — resilient global browsing and regional expansion

- **Development snapshot:** `2026-08-07T13:09:44+08:00`

### Added

- A Natural Earth 110m/50m/10m vector PMTiles overview with land, water, boundaries, places, roads, railways, and rivers through zoom 7.
- Region-aware elevation synchronization backed by AWS Open Data Terrain Tiles, with retained HGT manifests and maintenance progress.
- ETag-backed map-pack and boundary responses, deferred catalog loading, cache warming, and a browser performance smoke test.
- A machine-readable test-case catalog and unified `static`, `browser`, `full`, and `recovery` profiles, with static contracts running automatically on GitHub pull requests.

### Fixed

- Kept the verified existing geocoder and routing scope usable while newly installed regions are still being indexed.
- Kept a regional PMTiles vector fallback visible until OSM Carto has caught up, preventing blank maps after installing a region.
- Deduplicated overlapping regional OSM objects before Carto, search, and routing builds.
- Prevented map panning from rebuilding the complete MapLibre style or hiding installed layers still inside the viewport.
- Replaced rectangular country guesses with precise country polygons, including antimeridian handling, and suppressed low-zoom false download prompts.
- Normalized map-package prompts, resource names, feature details, and world-overview labels to display `台湾省` consistently.
- Normalized the weather JQ program to LF before mounting it into Linux containers, preventing repeated first-run failures for newly installed country packages on a Windows checkout.
- Normalized container-mounted shell scripts, waited for local Carto assets to become ready, and constrained heavy builds for a 16 GiB host.

### Improved

- Accelerated terrain tile generation by loading each required HGT grid once per row group instead of once per pixel.
- Minified the generated global catalog without changing its 547 browse regions or 554 buildable datasets, and enabled nginx compression and explicit config revalidation.
- Expanded world-map regression coverage for Carto lag, vector fallback, global movement, country selection, and persistent overview rendering.
- Added static JSON/PowerShell, bilingual-document parity, relative-link, browser-image completeness, and performance-baseline checks.

## M0.9 — Local OSM Carto rendering and cache reliability

- **Commit:** [`d360249`](https://github.com/bd4rex/personal-gis/commit/d360249de86110511eb7ae5f49e8237d810f5d96)
- **Timestamp:** `2026-08-04T16:22:49+08:00`
- **Git status at the time:** direct `main` commit; no tag or Release

### Fixed

- Prewarmed candidate OSM Carto tiles, copied validated cache entries during activation, and cleared them during rollback.
- Added dedicated Apache tile-render timeouts and nginx proxy timeouts for slow first renders.
- Synchronized local/online map-source controls and allowed deterministic URL coordinates for regression testing.

## M0.8 — Automatic regional strategy propagation

- **Commit:** [`6daeff6`](https://github.com/bd4rex/personal-gis/commit/6daeff6458177b6aa6b4f2ad1fe0dc4640027653)
- **Timestamp:** `2026-08-04T07:39:54+08:00`
- **Merged by:** [PR #7](https://github.com/bd4rex/personal-gis/pull/7)

### Added

- Blue-green OSM Carto candidate volumes with non-empty tile validation for every enabled region.
- Dynamic weather-location extraction, regional weather/nautical provenance, and elevation-coverage manifests.
- Automatic lightweight weather and nautical follow-up jobs after regional build, update, removal, enable, or disable changes the active scope.

### Fixed

- Included Shandong in OSM Carto, shared search/routing, weather, nautical, and elevation coverage after its base package was installed.
- Prevented whole-service health from hiding missing derivative coverage for newly installed regions.
- Compared per-region source SHA256 values, not only region IDs, before declaring search, routing, Carto, weather, or nautical coverage current.
- Resolved installed source paths from package manifests so later country and regional packages inherit the same pipelines.
- Removed the obsolete Jiangsu/Anhui Carto merge and pruned 97 unrelated historical HGT grids from the new routing candidate.

### Improved

- Reused verified local Carto water, ice-sheet, and low-zoom boundary archives instead of downloading them for every regional expansion.
- Added real Valhalla route checks for every enabled region and smoke-test assertions that derivative scopes match enabled packages.

## Pre-Git development record

The repository was first published on 2026-08-01, but [docs/PROCESS_LOG.md](docs/PROCESS_LOG.md) records local implementation work from 2026-07-03 onward. Those dates describe work events and validation evidence, not Git release timestamps.
